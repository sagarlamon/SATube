## 📖 About SATube

SATube is **not** just another wrapper script. It is a full-fledged, premium Linux CLI application built on top of `yt-dlp` and `FFmpeg`. Designed to be keyboard-friendly, visually stunning, and highly modular, SATube brings the comfort of a GUI directly into your terminal.

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Beautiful Terminal UI:** Powered by `Rich` and `Questionary`. No messy logs or text tearing.
- **🎥 Advanced Video & Audio:** Download up to 4K resolutions, extract audio (MP3, FLAC, WAV), and select custom formats.
- **🗂️ Queue Manager:** Paste multiple URLs, arrange them, and let SATube download them sequentially in the background.
- **📜 Download History:** Keep track of your downloads, search past files, and manage your media.
- **⚙️ Smart Configuration:** Remembers your favorite download folders, preferred quality, and formats automatically.
- **🖼️ Rich Metadata:** Automatically fetches and embeds thumbnails and metadata into your downloaded files.
- **🔔 Native Notifications:** Get desktop alerts when a download finishes.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure your system has the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.12** or newer
- **FFmpeg** (Required for merging video/audio and format conversion)
- **pipx** (Required for safe, isolated Python CLI app installation)

---

## 🚀 Installation

We provide a smart installation script that detects your Linux distribution (Arch, Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora) and automatically handles the heavy lifting, including system dependencies and `pipx` environment creation.

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sagarlamon/SATube.git
cd SATube

2. Make the installer executable
chmod +x install.sh

3. Run the installer
./install.sh

*(Note: If you just installed `pipx` for the first time, you may need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` before the `satube` command becomes available).*
